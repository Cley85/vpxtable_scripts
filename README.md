<h1>This repo contains script files of visual pinball tables.</h1>

I love SSF tables so much that I could not stand playing older tables
that didn't have updated 7.1 code in them. What I've done is to find
what I consider the most essential code that is common for most tables
and updated it so that the table itself is ready for improvements.

While I was on this task - forum user 'WOB' made a spreasheet of what
tables is expected to work with the so called FastFlips. With his
help I hope that all the tables listed here will work. You could, if
you for some odd reason DON'T want to update the whole script just
copy part of the code to add FastFlips.

Without the awesome work of DjRobX, nFozzy, Toxie and Fuzzel we would
still have flippers that varies between 0-20ms response time.
The community can't thank you enough guys !

**NOTE**:

Not including most of Loserman's tables. I saw that he planned changes
to them.  I hope they include updated routines. So, for the moment
those are kept _out_ of this repository.

_So. On to it - how do I use it ?_

If you have a table with the exact name as the script. I'm hopeful
that you will be able to open up the script inside the table and delete
everything, replacing it by the code provided. To be on the safe side
you might want to save it right away with a different name or you can
also just press play and only save __IF__ you find that the code is
working for you.

I've tried to use the latest available version of each table, but,
there is no guarantee.

Adding script from here will in some cases not only give you a upgrade,
it should actually fix some issues as well. There are a few tables that
hasn't been updated with the fixes provided by the community and I hope
that they are included here. If not, why don't we fix them ?

Trust me, it looks harder than it is.

If you contribute. Thank you very much. But, please test your changes
as best you can. We all makes mistakes, and no one is perfect.

_Comments_

You will in many cases find comments like where it says that the table
is made by JPSalas and that you need to be careful. Some of these tables
__are__ made by him. This might not always be true though. I started with
a template and kept that to remind myself that I should take extra care
when sounds are a walls in combination with PlaySoundAt.

Don't be scared to update the tekst if it makes sense and a short info
to what you changed if it makes sense.

_Future feature ?_

There has been talks about supporting "side-car" table support.
If VP gets this feature you should be able to just download the whole
archive as a zip and extract it into your tables folder as long as
the table script has the exact same name. Just like db2s backglasses.

__But for now that is not an option unfortunately.__
